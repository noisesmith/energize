;;
;; (local table-type {:a 1
;;                    :b 2
;;                    :c 3})
;;
;; (when body-type?
;;   (print "This form is indented in body type."))
;;
;; (local regular-call (this-is indented-as
;;                              a-regular "function call"))
;;
;; "this is none of the above."
