Welcome aboard the USS Lakota.

I'm Commander T'Ral. We're glad to have you aboard. We could always use another transporter operator.

The console in transporter room six might be a little different from what you're used to, so I've arranged for you to beam up a canister of quadrotriticale from the surface to get a little practice while we wait for Captain Benteen to finish her mission below.
