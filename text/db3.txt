Benteen: Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.

Darael: Thanks. I'm looking forward to getting out of this disguise.

Benteen: What can you tell us about your mission?

Darael: The levels of technology on Malcor observed by my team have been significantly higher than our predictions indicated; we strongly suspect outside influence.

Darael: Commander Juran and Lieutenant Kolimet have taken a runabout to investigate a possible source of cultural contamination. I recommend we rendezvous with them.
