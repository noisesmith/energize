Welcome aboard the USS Lakota.

I am Commander T'Ral. We are glad to have you aboard. We could always use another transporter operator.

The console in transporter room six might be a little different from what you are used to, so I have arranged for you to beam up a canister of quadrotriticale from the surface to get a little practice while we wait for Captain Benteen to finish her mission below.
