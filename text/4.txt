As we've pursued warp signature of the USS Chandrasekhar, we've received a coded subspace message from Lieutenant Commander Atanyo, an engineer aboard the ship. He is worried that his captain has gone rogue, and has provided us with detailed coordinates leading us to the ship.

Once we arrive, our first priority is to beam Atanyo over to the Lakota so we can assess the situation on the Chandrasekhar. He has arranged to lower the shields to allow this, but once he does this he will be in great danger, so we must act quickly.
