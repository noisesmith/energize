As we've pursued warp signature of the USS Chandrasekhar, we've received a coded subspace message from Lieutenant Commander Atanyo, an engineer aboard the ship. He is worried that his captain has gone rogue, and has provided us with detailed coordinates leading us to the ship.

Once we catch up, we will beam Captain Cunningham over to the Lakota to apprehend him; Atanyo has arranged to lower the shields for us. But we may expect resistance.
